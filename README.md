# android-fundamentals-my-work
My exercises done during the learning of Android Studio.

The tutorial that I followed: https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/overview-v2

The tutorials are great, but some are deprecated. I updated most exercises to have compileSdkVersion 26, or 30. Some exercises cannot be finished as they are outdated.
I tried to finish most of them, ignored some exercises like asynctask due to deprecation.
